# Amazon Web Services Tutorial
AWS tutorial is meant for beginners to learn AWS. Through this AWS tutorial, you will understand AWS architecture, various AWS products like S3, EC2, VPC, Route 53, Lambda, IAM, Redshift, RDS, DynamoDB, and others. You will come to know the advantages of AWS, migration from on-premise to AWS cloud, administration of AWS, and more from this easy-to-learn AWS tutorial.

Before we go ahead and take a deep dive into AWS, we need to be clear with some Cloud Computing concepts. I will be taking a top-down approach in teaching you AWS in this tutorial, so let’s start off by listing the topics that we will be learning in this AWS tutorial:


## Why Cloud Computing?
Let’s understand this using an example:

Let’s say, you are developing an application, something like Instagram. Now, you have this application ready on your computer. The next step is to make this available on the Internet so that people can browse and go to this website, right?

How would you go about it?

You will have to buy a server, on which you will be uploading your application.
Next, you will have to ensure that your application is always available, by hiring people to manage your server on which this application is hosted.
And of course, machines are bound to breakdown or they get outdated; therefore, you will have to keep a check on the server’s hardware whether it is up to date or not and be ready to spend some money if anything goes wrong.
Finally, the most important aspect, as your application grows in popularity among your users, your servers will become overburdened with all the traffic. You will have to think about scaling up, by keeping a constant check on the traffic on your application.
Seems do-able? Well, the above will not only take a lot of effort but it is going to be extremely expensive too!

Now, are you wondering how to solve it? Well, the answer is Cloud Computing. Let’s go ahead in this AWS tutorial and understand ‘What is Cloud Computing?’

## What is Cloud Computing?
Taking the same example forward,

With Cloud Computing, you can rent as many servers from your cloud provider as you want, and the cloud provider will charge you based on the number of hours you used your servers. If you used a server for 1 hour, you will only be charged for 1 hour; ‘no strings attached!’
You can configure redundancy in your servers, i.e., you can set up multiple copies of your servers in different data centers, which means if one of your servers becomes unresponsive, your application will still be served from any of the other deployed servers, hence ensuring high availability of your application.
Any hardware updates or breakdown of any server will be handled by your cloud provider. This will avoid a hole in your pocket!
Finally, you can configure autoscaling on your server fleet, i.e., whenever there is an increase in the traffic of your application, your cloud provider will automatically scale up your servers. And yes, if the traffic or the load decreases on your website, your servers will be scaled down automatically.
Quite interesting, isn’t it?
So in a nutshell, What is Cloud Computing?

The use of rented remote servers on the Internet, rather than using one of your own, is known as Cloud Computing.

Cloud Computing has led almost all new businesses to shift to the cloud; hence, not only are they saving the initial cost of starting a business with the correct IT infrastructure but their application is now being handled by various cloud providers such as Amazon, Microsoft, Google, etc. Amazing, isn’t it?

With Cloud Computing, you are getting a lot of added benefits, along with the drastically decreased infrastructural cost. Thanks to the amazing pricing models offered by your cloud provider.
## Why AWS?
What is AWS
Well, to answer this question, further in this [AWS tutorial](https://intellipaat.com/blog/tutorial/amazon-web-services-aws-tutorial/#), let’s have a look at some statistics:

AWS alone owns around 40 percent market share in the market, which is huge when you compare it with the second-largest cloud provider, i.e., Microsoft Azure, which owns around 16 percent of the market.
AWS is more reliable when compared to Microsoft and Google. This was concluded, based on the cumulative downtime of the past 4 years. AWS has had the least time in cloud outages, compared to Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure.
AWS is a more mature product as it was launched way back in 2006.
Keeping these facts in mind, when any new company enters the cloud space, it always looks for a cloud provider that has proven a history of handling complex applications, and when stakeholders think like this AWS has a lot to show in its past decade of cloud-hosting history.

For example, Netflix the world’s biggest premium video streaming service is completely hosted on AWS for its application needs.

The world’s largest e-commerce company, Amazon is also hosted on the AWS infrastructure.

Amazon Prime Video, which is yet another premium video streaming service from Amazon, is also hosted on AWS.

When you see such big players relying on the AWS infrastructure, you as a new guy in the cloud space would naturally be inclined toward AWS for your application-hosting needs.

Okay, we now understand why businesses prefer AWS for their hosting needs. Next, let us understand why it is beneficial for YOU to learn AWS.

Well, if most of the companies are preferring AWS for their hosting needs, it is quite obvious that they would require AWS Engineers for their infrastructure on AWS. This directly impacts the requirement of AWS-proficient candidates in the industry, in turn creating ample job opportunities for you to apply for. This is exactly why you should learn AWS. In this AWS tutorial, let’s summarize how it is beneficial for you to learn AWS:
It provides more job opportunities.
Since it is a mature product, there are fewer chances of changes in the future, hence offering job security.
It is also more reliable when compared to Google and Microsoft Azure.
So far in this AWS tutorial, we saw that AWS is the cloud provider that we should learn first when making a shift to the cloud sphere. Now, let us go ahead and understand what exactly AWS is.
